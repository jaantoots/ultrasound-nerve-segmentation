# Identify nerve structures in ultrasound images of the neck

Even the bravest patient cringes at the mention of a surgical
procedure. Surgery inevitably brings discomfort, and oftentimes
involves significant post-surgical pain. Currently, patient pain is
frequently managed through the use of narcotics that bring a bevy of
unwanted side effects.

This competition's sponsor is working to improve pain management
through the use of indwelling catheters that block or mitigate pain at
the source. Pain management catheters reduce dependence on narcotics
and speed up patient recovery.

Accurately identifying nerve structures in ultrasound images is a
critical step in effectively inserting a patientâ€™s pain management
catheter. In this competition, Kagglers are challenged to build a
model that can identify nerve structures in a dataset of ultrasound
images of the neck. Doing so would improve catheter placement and
contribute to a more pain free future.
